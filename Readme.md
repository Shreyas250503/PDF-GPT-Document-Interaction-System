# Chat with PDF using Google Gemini Pro

This project allows users to interact with PDF documents by asking questions using **Google Gemini Pro** and **LangChain**. The app processes uploaded PDF files, extracts their content, and lets users ask questions. It uses **FAISS** to create a vector index for efficient similarity search and **Google Generative AI** for conversational abilities.

## Features

- Upload multiple PDF files and process them for question-answering.
- Split text into chunks and generate embeddings using Google Generative AI.
- Efficient similarity search using FAISS for document indexing.
- Answer questions based on the contents of the uploaded PDFs.
