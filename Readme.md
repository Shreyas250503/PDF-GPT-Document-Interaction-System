# Chat with PDF using Google Gemini Pro

This project allows users to interact with PDF documents by asking questions using **Google Gemini Pro** and **LangChain**. The app processes uploaded PDF files, extracts their content, and lets users ask questions. It uses **FAISS** to create a vector index for efficient similarity search and **Google Generative AI** for conversational abilities.
